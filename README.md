## Reddit but Reddit

*Hello, my name is @RedBlueBird and I am here to pitch you our idea. \
Did you know that most blackboards are green? \
Or that calorie and Calorie represent two different units? \
And that pencil lead is actually not made of lead instead graphite? \
We as humans are innately curious about all things around us. We love to explore and search for answers to our unsolved mysteries by nature. But unfortunately, as people are crammed with more and more work from jobs or schoolwork and stimulated more and more by devices, they have less and less time and energy to devote to experiencing the vast seas of knowledge. \
People are attentive to quick, engaging facts, a result of most people’s short attention spans. We propose to create a platform where people may create their own fun facts and share them with others, like a social media but for knowledge. We’ll give the gift of trivia to people who wouldn’t normally be able to - just one fact at a time. \
Thank you.
